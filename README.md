A white noise and alarm clock for the kids on a raspberry pi

These features will be implemented:
* Alarm clock
* Nature sounds/white noise
* lamp

I'd like for this to function as an alarm clock that plays the nature sounds/white noise.  It would have the option to wake up to the nature sounds or music or an alarm sound and it would slowly illuminate like a rising sun.  When it is fully illuminated, the alarm (whatever sound we choose) would go off.  Like a rooster crowing
